							<h1 class="major">2018 NBA Playoffs: Player Shot Charts</h1>
							<p style = "font-size:18px"> There have been some great playoff performances by numerous key players. However, it's rather easy to be trapped in awe of performances as you watch them live while being completely oblivious to the fact that your favorite player is actually shooting a below average field goal percentage.</p>
							<p style = "font-size:18px">In this notebook, we'll take a look at certain players' offensive performance by creating go-to visualization: The shot chart. This notebook is largely inspired from the post at https://moderndata.plot.ly/nba-shots-analysis-using-plotly-shapes/, and the first shot chart built here closely follows the process from that post. After building the basic chart that plots shots on the court, we'll then look to improve on it by adding colored shot zones.</p>

									<h2 id="build" class="major">Building the Court</h2>
									<p style = "font-size:18px">With the help of Plotly shapes we'll be able to build the NBA court on our plot. All of these shapes were found from the post at https://moderndata.plot.ly/nba-shots-analysis-using-plotly-shapes/.</p>
									<h2 id="plot" class="major">Plotting the Shots</h2>
									<p style = "font-size:18px">With the court's shapes in place we can now use our trusty data to create our visualization, with the option to view the shot chart of any of the 8 impact players.</p>

<iframe src="images/file.html" height="700" width="700"frameBorder="0"></iframe>

<h2 id="shot" class="major">Adding Shot Zones</h2>
									<p style = "font-size:18px">Visualization above usefulness could probably be improved with the addition of colored shot zones that allow us to see just how well a player is shooting from certain spots on the court. To figure out what different zones we'll be able to divide the shots into, let's take a look at the different SHOT_ZONE_AREA and SHOT_ZONE_BASIC values from our dataset.</p>
									<p style = "font-size:18px">Code will skip zones 3 to 11 as this is repetetive</p>

<iframe src="images/file2.html" height="700" width="700"frameBorder="0"></iframe>

<h2 id="calc" class="major">Calculating the Baseline FG% for Each Shot Zone</h2>
									<p style = "font-size:18px">Because we'll be adding colored shot zones to the new plot, we need a way to figure out what should be considered a "hot" FG% (red-shaded) and what should be considered a "cold" FG% (blue-shaded). The way we can determine such a baseline is by using the average FG% in each of these zones among all players throughout the 2018 playoffs. Anything above this average will be considered hot and anything below will be considered cold.</p>

	<pre><code style = "font-size:14px">League Average FG% by Zone
center_3: 32.11%
left_center_3: 35.9%
right_center_3: 34.16%
left_corner_3: 35.07%
right_corner_3: 37.14%
center_mid: 45.69%
left_center_mid: 39.55%
right_center_mid: 44.03%
left_mid: 40.17%
right_mid: 45.63%
paint: 35.81%
restricted_area: 70.34%</code></pre>

<h2 id="help" class="major">Helpful Functions</h2>
									<p style = "font-size:18px">In order to help us craft our upgraded shot chart with colored zones, it's probably a good idea to have a few functions to help us out. First, we need one that will tell us what a given player's FG% is in each of the zones. This will help us appropriately color each of the player's shot zones.</p>
	<p style = "font-size:18px">Once we have a means of getting the player shot zone field goal percentages, we can then run each FG% through a function that returns a reasonable color from the hot/cold colorscale.</p>										
	<pre><code style = "font-size:14px">def getZoneColor(zone_name, pct):
    if (pct is None):
        return (184,184,184,0.5)
    else:
        cmap = matplotlib.cm.get_cmap('seismic')
        my_cmap = cmap(np.arange(cmap.N))
        my_cmap[:,-1] = np.concatenate(((np.linspace(0.8, 0.2, int(cmap.N/2)), np.linspace(0.2, 0.8, int(cmap.N/2)))))
        cmap = matplotlib.colors.ListedColormap(my_cmap)
        rgba = cmap(0.5 + ((pct - league_averages[zone_name])/league_averages[zone_name]/2))            
        return rgba</code></pre>
